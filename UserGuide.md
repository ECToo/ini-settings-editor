# Quick Start #

  * By default, the program tried to load a file called `Settings.ini`, if it exists.

  * If it cannot find `Settings.ini`, it will be blank with no options since you did not specify an INI file. **Hit CTRL+D to go into Developer Mode**. That will present options like "Open" etc.

  * You can open INI editor with a command line parameter so that it opens the INI file you want: `inieditor MySettingsFile.ini`

  * By using the shell command in just about any programming language, you can now open up your settings INI file.
