HOW TO GET STARTED:
Launch INIEditor.EXE
Hit CTRL+D to enter DEVELOPER MODE. You can then open INI files and take a look!

Alternatively:
- If you want to use it as an editor, just set up Windows to use it to open INI files.
- If you are a developer, just "shell" INIEditor with your ini file for editing, ex:
INIEditor myIniFile.txt

NOTE: You can delete the free_settings_icons_deletable folder. Those are open-source sample
icons you can use. It's a small subset of the ones I found, you can find more online.
